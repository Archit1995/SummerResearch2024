In category theory, one way to view polynomial interpolation is by considering it as a **natural isomorphism** between two functors that, in essence, encode the process of evaluating polynomials on a set of points. Here’s one way to set up the perspective:

---

### **1. Setting the Stage: Categories and Functors**

- **Objects:**
  - Let \( \mathcal{V} \) be the category of vector spaces over a field \( \Bbbk \).
  - Fix a natural number \( n \). Consider the vector space \( \mathbb{P}_n \) of polynomials of degree at most \( n \). This is an object in \( \mathcal{V} \).

- **Discrete Category of Nodes:**
  - Consider a finite discrete category \( \mathcal{D} \) whose objects are the \( n+1 \) distinct interpolation nodes \( \{x_0, x_1, \dots, x_n\} \). (Being discrete means there are only identity morphisms.)

- **Functors of Interest:**
  - **Polynomial Functor:** Define a functor
    \[
    P: \mathcal{D} \to \mathcal{V}, \quad \text{by sending the (set of) nodes to } \mathbb{P}_n.
    \]
    Here \( \mathbb{P}_n \) is independent of the node, but conceptually we think of it as “the space of candidate interpolants.”
  
  - **Evaluation Functor:** Define another functor
    \[
    E: \mathcal{D} \to \mathcal{V}, \quad \text{by sending each node } x_i \text{ to } \Bbbk,
    \]
    and on the level of objects, we can aggregate this into the product space
    \[
    E(\mathcal{D}) = \prod_{i=0}^{n} \Bbbk \cong \Bbbk^{n+1}.
    \]
    This functor represents the “target” of evaluation, i.e., assigning to a polynomial its value at each node.

---

### **2. The Evaluation Map as a Natural Transformation**

- **Evaluation Map:**  
  For a given polynomial \( p \in \mathbb{P}_n \), we define the evaluation map
  \[
  \operatorname{ev}(p) = \big( p(x_0), p(x_1), \dots, p(x_n) \big) \in \Bbbk^{n+1}.
  \]
  This evaluation process defines a linear map
  \[
  \operatorname{ev}: \mathbb{P}_n \to \Bbbk^{n+1}.
  \]
  
- **Natural Transformation:**  
  In categorical language, the evaluation process can be seen as a **natural transformation** between the functors that assign to a polynomial its values at the nodes. More precisely, if we view the functor \( \operatorname{ev} \) as
  \[
  \operatorname{ev}: P \Rightarrow E,
  \]
  then for each “object” (or index corresponding to a node) the components of this natural transformation are given by evaluation at that node. The fact that the diagram
  \[
  \begin{array}{ccc}
  \mathbb{P}_n & \xrightarrow{\operatorname{ev}} & \Bbbk^{n+1} \\
  \downarrow &  & \downarrow \\
  \mathbb{P}_n & \xrightarrow{\operatorname{ev}} & \Bbbk^{n+1}
  \end{array}
  \]
  commutes (trivially here because \( \mathcal{D} \) is discrete) means that this evaluation is “natural” with respect to the structure of the nodes.

---

### **3. Isomorphism and Representability**

- **Isomorphism in \( \mathcal{V} \):**  
  When the interpolation nodes \( \{x_i\} \) are distinct, the map
  \[
  \operatorname{ev}: \mathbb{P}_n \to \Bbbk^{n+1}
  \]
  is an isomorphism in the category \( \mathcal{V} \). This is the categorical statement of the fact that every tuple \( (y_0, \dots, y_n) \) corresponds uniquely to a polynomial in \( \mathbb{P}_n \).

- **Representable Functor Perspective:**  
  More abstractly, consider the Yoneda embedding which tells us that any object \( A \) in a category \( \mathcal{C} \) gives rise to a representable functor
  \[
  \operatorname{Hom}_{\mathcal{C}}(A, -).
  \]
  In our context, the polynomial ring (or space) \( \mathbb{P}_n \) represents the functor that assigns to each node the evaluation at that node. The natural isomorphism given by polynomial interpolation is then an instance of the Yoneda lemma, where the “points” (evaluation at nodes) capture all the information about the polynomial.

---

### **4. Summary**

In summary, from a category theory perspective:

- **Polynomial interpolation** establishes a natural transformation between the functor that assigns to the polynomial space \( \mathbb{P}_n \) and the evaluation functor that assigns the product space \( \Bbbk^{n+1} \).
- When the interpolation nodes are distinct, this natural transformation is a natural isomorphism in the category of vector spaces.
- This is analogous to the statement that the evaluation functor is **representable**—each polynomial is completely determined by its values on a set of \( n+1 \) nodes.
- The structure we observe is not just an accident of linear algebra but is rooted in deeper categorical principles like naturality and representability.

This categorical viewpoint provides a unified way to understand interpolation as not just a computational tool, but as an instance of a more general phenomenon where evaluation (a homomorphism in several senses) relates objects (polynomials) to their “coordinates” (values at nodes) via a natural isomorphism.
