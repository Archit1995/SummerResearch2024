We are given a system of equations in n variables, x1..xn and m parameters, y1,..,ym
The objective is to solve the system of linear equations
We create the Augmented matrix [A|b] and row reduce the Augmented matrix RREF([A|b])
RREF(b) will contain the solution

Note, the entries of augmented matrix and the coefficient matrix are in K[y1,...,ym] 

Input to black box,points [alpha1,..,alpha_m]
Output: Det(A(alpha1,..,alpha_m))
Rough Pseudocode.
Input: Black box to augmented matrix [A|b] \in K[y1,..ym]
Output: Det of Augmented matrix 
Step1 Feed Random points to augmented matrix BB.
Step2 Get [y_i]
