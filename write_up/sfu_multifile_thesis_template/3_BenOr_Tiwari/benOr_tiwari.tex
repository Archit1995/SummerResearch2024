\chapter{Ben-Or and Tiwari's Multivariate Polynomial Interpolation}
\section{Introduction}
Ben-Or Tiwari is an multivariate interpolation algorithm that interpolates 
all the variables of the polynomial simultaneously as opposed to Zippel's multivariate
interpolation algorithm which interpolates the variables one by one.
